# BinaryClassifier
InterfaceGan: Sample General Binary Classifier.



This is my playground to build a binary classifier for the celeb-A dataset to guide Edits in StyleGAN space. All are compatible with InterfaceGan.

Note that it does not contain any domain adaptation tricks. So, running on FFHQ data set is not ideal, but good enough.
